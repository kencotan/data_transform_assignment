# Data Transformation Assignment Details

An e-commerce platform has purchase transaction data with the following details:

waktu_pembelian (purchase_time)

user_id -> ID of the user making the purchase

store_id -> ID of the seller when the user makes the purchase

barang_id (item_id) -> ID of the item purchased

jumlah_barang (item_quantity) -> Quantity of items purchased in a single transaction
